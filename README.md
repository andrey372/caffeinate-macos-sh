# caffeinate-macos-sh
script to keep MacBook **system & display** awake, even with closed lid.

- **Amphetamine** app replacement;
- built-in **caffeinate -d** doesn't work with closed lid.

# usage:
Run the script normally. If at any point you wish to stop it before the duration ends, simply press Ctrl+C, and the script will restore the sleep settings and exit.

Adjust **DURATION** for desired time in seconds.
